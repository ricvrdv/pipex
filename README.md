# 42 - PIPEX

### [MILESTONE 2]

### SUMMARY
Pipex is a project that replicates the behavior of the Unix pipeline (|). It takes input and output files along with two shell commands, executing them in sequence while redirecting the output of the first command to the input of the second.

Simulates shell piping:
```
< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
```
